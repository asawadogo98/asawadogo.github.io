# My Arduino Program to turn on Random LEDs ar Random Brightness: 
This Assignment really tested our understanding of arrays in code. Using one array, I wrote a code that would write out to a random value in the array which corresponded with the LEDs. I also then wrote a line of code that would send out random brightness levels to random pins.

# PRO-TIP:
Remember that you have to account for a random brightness level AND the random pin.
