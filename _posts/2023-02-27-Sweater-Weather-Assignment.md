## My Sweater Weather Assignment 
For this assignment, had to creat a program in C where I created variables and placed if, else, and or conditions on them to get different output. If I were to tell my past self anything, it would be to pay attention to the the narrative sense of if, else, and or statements so that I can understand my results. The screenshot of my output is below:
