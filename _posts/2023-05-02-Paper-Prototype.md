# The Paper Prototype of My Project
For my project, I am sewing a bonnet that I will be using to protect my hair at night. I'm going to attach bands at the bonnet where all my components will be. I did a scaled paper prototype of the bands with all the components and stitching I would need. I didn't do a prototype of the bonnet cap because it would just be a large circle with a 10 inch diameter.
