# My C-Program to turn LEDs on or off: 
  For this assignment, I had to write a C-program to turn on colored lights on theoretical LEDs. In order to do so, I had to state my runtimes, index, pcount. I set conditions to my index and pcount so that I could print specific colors based on the conditions of my index and pcount. 
# This is an image of the output that I recieved for 100 runtimes:
