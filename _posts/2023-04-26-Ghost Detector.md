# Ghost Detector Assignement:
For this assignment, I had to program my Lilypadboard to make a set of LEDs light up in the vent that it was cold and dark. Therefore, I had to make sure my code accounted for the various other situations that are not "Cold AND dark." I was able to do so usng booleans. I also had to sense for light and temperature in order to find the randge at which it would be considered cold or dark.

# Pro-Tip
Make sure to choose a reasonable value for both cold and dark that aligns with the values printed out by Arduino.
