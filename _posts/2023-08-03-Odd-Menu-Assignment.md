# My C-Program to turn LEDs on or off: 
  This assignment was a mental exercise on nested "if" statements. We had to create conditions that would create either a even menu, or secret odd menu. The input to determine that would be based on the number that a hypotyherical customer could select. For each menu type, there where three menu types and if a hypotheical customer tried to select more than one of those three choices, lets say like number 7, it would be an invalid entry sinc the limit is three for each menu type. 
# Here are images of two possible outputs:

![oddmenu](https://asawadogo98.github.io/assets/img/off.png)
# PRO-TIP:
Pay attention to the syntax in your code. It can be easy to misplace brackets when your nesting different statements.
