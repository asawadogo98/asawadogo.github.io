# The Assignement Task:
For this assignment, I had to program my Lilypad board to output my name in morse code when the switch is on. I then had to code it to output a buzzer sound SOS when the switch is off. I also had to make sure to write my code as functions that would be easy to call.
# The Set-Up:

# Pro-Tip
Make sure that you make functionsto put your lines of code into, so that it's easier to call.
