# My C-Program to turn LEDs on or off: 
  This assignment was a bit of a trickster. I had to think logically about the conditions underwitch some or all of the LEDs would be on or off. Luckily, based on my plushy prootype, I knew that it wasn't possible for some of the LEDs to be on while others were off if they were operating on the same circuit. Thus, the LEDs woud only be on if both the button and switch were on and they'd all be off if both the button and switch were off. With this logic, I was able to create the conditions that I coded. Here are the screenshot of the outputs I recieved: 
# LEDS ON:
# LEDS OFF:
