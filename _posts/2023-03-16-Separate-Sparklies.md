# My Project: 
  For this assignment, I mimicked the flashing patterns of three different firefies. Namely, the "Flashbub" firefly, the "Big Dipper" firefly, and the Synchronous fireflies. I coded three separate files on Arduinofor each firely and demoed it on a Lilypad circuit. In the end, I was able to code the LED paptterns to match that of each firefly.
# This is an image of the output that I recieved for the Flashbub Firefly :
  What's not shown in this image is the flashing pattern, which is a light that blinks every four seconds.

# This is an image of the output that I recieved for the Big Dipper Firefly :
  What's not shown in this image is the flashing pattern, which is a light that incremently gets brighter for one second and then restarts every three seconds.
# This is an image of the output that I recieved for the Synchronous Firefly :
  What's not shown in this image is the flashing pattern, which is a light that blinks rapidly three times for 0.2 seconds and then restarts every ten seconds.
